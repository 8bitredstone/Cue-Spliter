# Cue-Spliter
Script to split a single audio file using a CUE sheet (.cue file)

# Requirements
Needs ffmpeg downloaded and added to path

executable only runs on windows, thus on mac and linux you will need python
so you can instead run the python file

# Usage
first cue file and audio file must be within the same folder/directory
then simply run the script with the required arguments

# Note
sorry for messy/bad code this was made over the course of an afternoon

executable built with pyinstaller
